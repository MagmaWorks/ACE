                        Fire design is based on EN 1992-1-2. The fire design of columns is usually based on the tables provided in the code. 
                        However, other methods - called simplified methods - are suggested for a more accurate estimation of columns capacity under fire condition.
                        The Column Design apps developed by Magma Works integrates the classic table, the two simplified methods and an advanced method developed in-house
                        and based on the calculation of the interaction diagram of the column under fire conditions.

                                    ( <Hyperlink> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation </Hyperlink>). When tables are used, the temperature

                                    The eurocode provides 3 different temperature curves (Section 3.2 EN 1991-1-2). The most commonly used and 
                                    recommended curve is the standard temperature curve which is used internationally. The external 
                                    curve must be used for external fires but shouldn't be used unless explicitly mentioned. The hydrocarbon curve can be used 
                                    for columns located in car parks where typical fires show faster increase in temperature.<LineBreak/>

                                The common method for defining the fire load case is to multiply the considered design load case by a factor 0.7 giving then 
                                the fire design load case. However, the eurocode allows to define dedicated fire load case. In section 2.4.2 in EN 1992-1-2 is defined
                                the reduction factor for the fire situation. This factor is the ratio between design load values and fire design load values. It is defined
                                as the ratio between the load case DL+SDL+0.5LL and the ULS load combination. Assuming that the ULS combination is the load combination used 
                                for the design of the column, the fire load combination is therefore <Run FontWeight="SemiBold">DL + SDL + 0.5LL</Run>. This load combination 
                                is usually less conservative than 0.7*ULS.

                                    The table method is based on the table 5.2a in the  Eurocode EN1992-1-2. This table provides the minimum thickness and the concrete cover needed for a given fire resistance 
                                    and for a given ratio between fire axial load and axial load resistance (called &#956;). This method, although very easy and straightforward, has two main drawbacks. First, it is 
                                    a discrete method, meaning that it provides results for only 3 different possible values of &#956;. The method can therefore only yield conservative results (since associated with a 
                                    bigger &#956; value than the actual one). Then, this method is only based on the axial load and does not consider moments. The combination of those two observations makes the method
                                    sometimes too conservative, sometimes too unconservative. Following methods mitigate those problems by providing systematic solutions considering axials loads and moments.

                                    the column section is reduced by this thickness on its exposed edges. The resulting section is assumed to keep the same properties and 
                                    is then used to calculate the resistance of the column under fire conditions.
